## ‚ú® Features

- **Smart Search**: Get detailed nutritional analysis for any food by simply typing its name.
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Provides a full breakdown of macronutrients, vitamins, and minerals per 100g serving.
- **AI-Generated Images**: Each food search is accompanied by a unique, high-quality image generated by AI.
- **Health Insights**: Understand the science-backed health benefits and potential risks of overconsumption for each food.
- **Healthier Alternatives**: Discover suggestions for healthier food swaps with clear reasons.
- **Food Comparison**: Add multiple foods to a comparison list to easily contrast their key nutritional values (calories, protein, carbs, fat).
- **Responsive & Modern UI**: A clean, accessible, and mobile-friendly design with a dark mode toggle.
- **Engaging Animations**: Subtle animations provide a smooth and dynamic user experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: [React](https://react.dev/) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **AI/LLM**: [Google Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/) (`gemini-2.5-flash` for data, `gemini-2.5-flash-image` for images)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Icons**: Heroicons (via React components)
- **Build Tool**: Vite (inferred from `index.html` setup)

## üöÄ How It Works

1.  **User Input**: A user enters a food name into the search bar (e.g., "avocado").
2.  **Gemini Data Request**: The app sends a structured prompt to the Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash` model), requesting detailed nutritional information. The request specifies a JSON schema for a consistent and reliable response format.
3.  **Gemini Image Request**: Simultaneously, a prompt is sent to the `gemini-2.5-flash-image` model to generate a realistic photo of the food.
4.  **Data Rendering**: The application parses the JSON response and dynamically renders the information in a structured, easy-to-read `FoodCard` component.
5.  **Comparison**: Users can add the food to a comparison list, which is managed in the app's state and displayed in a separate `ComparisonView` component.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- An active internet connection.
- A modern web browser.
- A **Google Gemini API Key**. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the files):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/dr-foodie.git
    cd dr-foodie
    ```

2.  **Set up your API Key:**
    The application loads the API key from `process.env.API_KEY`. You will need to configure this environment variable in your development environment. For example, you could use a `.env` file and a library like `dotenv`.

    Create a file named `.env` in the project root and add your key:
    ```
    API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies and run the project:**
    This project is set up to run in an environment with pre-bundled dependencies (like the one it was built in). If you were to run it locally with a standard Node.js setup, you would typically run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```
